<p>Afghanistan faces one of the worldâ€™s most acute internal displacement crises as it suffers protracted conflict and insecurity as well as recurring disasters, including droughts, floods, storms and earthquakes. Displacement has become a common coping strategy for many Afghans and, in some cases, an inevitable feature of life for multiple generations. <a href="https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/sites/www.humanitarianresponse.info/files/documents/files/afghanistan_humanitarian_needs_overview_2021.pdfhttps://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/AFG_REACH_WoAA_MSNI-Analysis-Report_September-2019_final-2.pdf">Humanitarian needs</a> are high and the situation is further complicated by widespread poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to basic services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over 404,000 new displacements associated with conflict and violence were recorded in 2020, and there were 3.5 million people internally displaced as a result at the end of the year. This latter figure is an 18 per cent increase compared with 2019 and the highest figure in more than a decade. Disasters throughout 2020 triggered more than 46,000 new displacements, with most displacements caused by flooding in March, May, and August, particularly affecting the eastern provinces.</p>
