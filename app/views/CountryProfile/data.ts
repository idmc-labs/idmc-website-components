<p>Afghanistan faces one of the world’s most acute internal displacement crises as it suffers protracted conflict and insecurity as well as recurring disasters, including droughts, floods, storms and earthquakes. Displacement has become a common coping strategy for many Afghans and, in some cases, an inevitable feature of life for multiple generations. <a href="https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/sites/www.humanitarianresponse.info/files/documents/files/afghanistan_humanitarian_needs_overview_2021.pdfhttps://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/AFG_REACH_WoAA_MSNI-Analysis-Report_September-2019_final-2.pdf">Humanitarian needs</a> are high and the situation is further complicated by widespread poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to basic services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over 404,000 new displacements associated with conflict and violence were recorded in 2020, and there were 3.5 million people internally displaced as a result at the end of the year. This latter figure is an 18 per cent increase compared with 2019 and the highest figure in more than a decade. Disasters throughout 2020 triggered more than 46,000 new displacements, with most displacements caused by flooding in March, May, and August, particularly affecting the eastern provinces.</p>

<p>The compounding impacts of conflict and disasters have exacted a <a href="https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/AFG_REACH_WoAA_MSNI-Analysis-Report_September-2019_final-2.pdf">heavy toll</a> on the population. In 2020, <a href="http://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1152907/#:~:text=Between%20November%202020%20and%20March,Phase%203)%20and%20nearly%204.3">11.15 million people</a> were estimated to be experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). This is particularly <a href="https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/sites/www.humanitarianresponse.info/files/documents/files/afghanistan_humanitarian_needs_overview_2021.pdf">true for IDP</a>s, whose ability to maintain adequate food consumption and nutrition is hindered by tenure insecurity and unemployment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Shelter needs are particularly acute, with a recent assessment indicating shelter needs as the second priority need after food. The majority of IDPs live in <a href="https://www.nrc.no/perspectives/2020/how-ana-got-a-roof-over-her-head/">informal settlements</a> and makeshift shelters. IDPs who settle on government or private land are at heightened <a href="https://www.internal-displacement.org/global-report/grid2019/downloads/background_papers/HirschHolland_FinalPaper.pdf">risk of eviction</a> and inadequate shelter also makes people more vulnerable to the impacts of sudden-onset disasters such as floods and avalanches, heightening their <a href="https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/sites/www.humanitarianresponse.info/files/documents/files/afghanistan_humanitarian_needs_overview_2021.pdf">risk of secondary displacement</a>. Conditions in informal settlements are dire and IDPs often lack access to water and sanitation facilities and face acute protection concerns. IDP and refugee households report high levels of early marriage, gender-based violence, and exploitation.</p><p></p>

    internalDisplacementUpdates: `
<p></p><p>India is exposed to a range of <a href="https://www.undrr.org/publication/disaster-risk-reduction-india-status-report-2020">natural hazards</a>. Around 68 per cent of the country is prone to drought, 60 per cent to earthquakes and 75 per cent of the coastline is vulnerable to cyclones and tsunamis. These physical factors combine with the country’s high population density, poverty levels, rapid urbanisation and environmental degradation to make it the country most at risk of disaster displacement in South Asia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Areas on the east coast are vulnerable to tropical storms that form in the Bay of Bengal, while northern states that border Nepal and Pakistan experience frequent seismic activity. Most of the country is affected by monsoon rains, but highly flood-prone areas include the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna river basins in the Indo-Gangetic plain in the north and north-east.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Extended monsoon seasons are becoming the norm. The withdrawal of the 2020 south-west monsoon was not completed until late October. Such changes prompted the Indian Meteorological Department to take the unprecedented step of <a href="https://internal.imd.gov.in/press_release/20200515_pr_804.pdf">revising its monsoon onset and withdrawal dates</a>. It has moved the date of the start of the withdrawal from 1 to 17 September, effectively prolonging the monsoon by more than two weeks. The 2020 south-west monsoon affected 22 Indian states and territories, triggering about 763,000 displacements between early June and late October.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Drought displacement has also been recorded in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra in recent years. There is little robust data available to estimate its scale, but water shortages in Maharashtra between March and June 2019 forced about 50,000 farmers and their families to take <a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/photo-feature/2019/05/08/india-cattle-camps-are-last-resort-families-facing-drought">refuge in “cattle camps”</a>, displacement sites run by NGOs where livestock is also fed and watered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were thought to be around 900,000 people living in internal displacement as a result of disasters across the country as of 31 December 2020, but the figure is highly conservative given the high number of new displacements and the damages and losses recorded during the year.<br>
Conflict displacement is also a regular occurrence, but it can be complex to track and obtain comprehensive data on because the violence is often very localised, and largely linked to identity and ethnicity. The main long-standing conflicts revolve around the disputed <a href="https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-between-india-and-pakistan">Kashmir</a> region, separatism in the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/nationalities-papers/article/abs/understanding-ethnicitybased-autonomy-movements-in-indias-northeastern-region/9DD7F10C7E8BF30C3E52E9A10365AF16">north-eastern states</a>, and the <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2017/09/half-a-century-of-indias-maoist-insurgency/">Naxalite-Maoist insurgency</a> in the so-called “red corridor” of central and eastern states, predominantly Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. Localised violence such as the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-24172537">2013 Muzaffarnagar riots</a> can also quickly lead to significant displacement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Displacement in Jammu and Kashmir is driven by ongoing clashes near the line of control between Indian and Pakistani-administered areas. After years of precarious peace following a ceasefire in 2003, tensions flared in 2016 with a series of cross-border raids by the Indian military and cross-border militant attacks into India. Cross-border shelling that began in 2017 increased in intensity in 2018 and forced more than 160,000 people from their homes.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-asia/kashmir">suicide attack</a> that killed 40 soldiers in Indian-administered Kashmir in February 2019 led to retaliatory airstrikes and sporadic shelling near the line of control that continued into March. At least 2,600 displacements were recorded, but comprehensive figures were hard to obtain. Further shelling across the line of control later in the year triggered more displacement.</p>

<p>Tensions in Jammu and Kashmir and between Hindu and Muslim communities across India have risen since late-2019. The federal government <a href="https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-between-india-and-pakistan">revoked the special status</a> accorded to Indian-administered Kashmir in August 2019 and imposed a curfew, which led to protests that were met with force. Telecommunications and internet access were shut down, making it difficult to obtain information, including on displacement.</p>

<p>In December 2019, the government passed the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) which offers a pathway to citizenship for undocumented residents from several countries but excludes Muslims. Protests erupted and by February 2020, had escalated into <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2020/04/09/shoot-traitors/discrimination-against-muslims-under-indias-new-citizenship-policy">inter-communal violence</a>. Over the course of three days, 52 people died, and Muslim homes and businesses were targeted by violent mobs. More than 1,800 people were forced to flee and shelter in camps in Delhi. Clashes and violence occurred in Assam and Uttar Pradesh states, but displacement figures are unknown.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.internal-displacement.org/global-report/grid2019/downloads/background_papers/Jaideep_FinalPaper.pdf">Development projects</a> also have the potential to displace large numbers of people although comprehensive data on the topic is difficult to obtain. These include dams, mines, industrial plants, urban renewal and environmental conservation projects. IDMC conducted a <a href="https://www.internal-displacement.org/sites/default/files/publications/documents/201607-ap-india-pushed-aside-en.pdf">study</a> in 2016 which found that the risk of displacement is significant because large-scale land acquisitions can aggravate intercommunal tensions and lead to <a href="http://hlrn.org.in/documents/Housing_Land_Rights_UPRIII_HLRN.pdf">conflict over land</a> access and use.&nbsp;</p>

            <p></p><p>The fate of people displaced in India constitutes a significant information gap, particularly for those who do not live in formal camps or resettlement areas. No comprehensive humanitarian assessment of IDPs’ needs has been conducted at the national level. Some reports, however, show that some socially excluded communities such as scheduled castes, indigenous groups and religious minorities are often <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/funding/decisions/2014/HIPs/india_en.pdf">disproportionally at risk</a> of becoming displaced, and may be propelled further into poverty and marginalisation as a result. In many cases, facilities and services for IDPs are <a href="http://wghr.org/images/WGHR_UPR_Mid-Term_Re_q1n5r.pdf">limited or non-existent</a>.&nbsp;</p>

The history of conflict displacement in Afghanistan goes back to the late 1970s. War between the Soviet-backed government and mujahideen fighters and the Soviet occupation triggered large-scale internal displacement and refugee flows in the 1980s. The fall of the government in 1992, ensuing ethnic conflict between mujahideen factions and the rise of the Taliban in the late 1990s displaced millions more.

<p>Every year, India has some of the highest levels of disaster displacement in South Asia and globally. The majority of the displacements are triggered by flooding during the monsoon seasons. The country is also prone to other sudden and slow-onset hazards including earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, storm surges and drought. Protracted conflict in Indian-administered Kashmir, and localised inter-communal violence also trigger displacement every year, but to a much lesser extent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were 3.9 million new disaster displacements in India in 2020, the result of a combination of increasing hazard intensity, high population exposure and high levels of social and economic vulnerability. Most displacements took the form of pre-emptive evacuations before Cyclone Amphan made landfall in May 2020. Amphan triggered more than 2.4 million evacuations in the states of West Bengal and Odisha. Cyclone Nisarga prompted another 170,000 evacuations in the western states of Maharashtra and Gujarat just two weeks later. Such extreme weather events are no longer exceptional, and severe cyclones are only <a href="https://indiaclimatedialogue.net/2020/06/05/cyclones-rise-as-climate-change-heats-up-indian-ocean/">expected to increase</a> in number and intensity on both the east and west coasts of the Indian subcontinent.</p>

<p>In recent years, displacement has been reported in Indian-controlled Kashmir and other areas in the country, but figures are hard to come by due to access constraints and lack of reporting. Tensions between Hindu and Muslim communities have been rising since the Citizenship Amendment Act was passed in 2019. They led to widespread violent protests in 2020, notably in Delhi in February, when more than 1,800 people were forced to shelter in camps.</p>
